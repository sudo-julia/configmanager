# configmanager.py

A batteries-included configuration-file manager for Python projects.
Ships with only the needed part of [appdirs](https://github.com/ActiveState/appdirs)
as to not require any external dependencies.

## Introduction

For a while, I've been implementing various half-baked ways to manage config files
in my Python projects. None of them are portable, tested or complete. `configmanager`
aims to change that, serving a portable (no external dependencies) solution to reading
from and writing to configuration files.

## Installation

Coming soon...

### Requirements

- Python 3.6 or above

## Usage

Coming soon...

## TODO

- [ ] Config file templates
- [ ] Add support for different configuration types
- [ ] Remove appdirs dependency?
